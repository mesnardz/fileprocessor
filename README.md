# fileprocessor
File processor with unit tests

This project uses Visual Studio VS 2015.
The project is a simple console application and does not have any 3rd party dependancies.

The import and export directory are defaulted to an import and export folder where the application is run.
In this instance these folder will already be created inside the default debug directory:
    Import/data.csv
    Export/
